# Express.js POST Request Handler Silent Failure

This repository demonstrates a common but subtle issue in Express.js applications where a POST request handler performs an asynchronous operation but fails to send a response to the client, leading to seemingly unresponsive behavior.  The problem is rooted in the lack of response handling after the asynchronous operation completes.

## Bug

The `bug.js` file contains an Express.js server that handles POST requests to the `/data` endpoint.  It processes data asynchronously using `someAsyncOperation`, but forgets to send a response using `res.send()` or `res.json()` after the promise resolves. This results in the client waiting indefinitely for a response.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version of the server. It ensures that a response is sent to the client regardless of the outcome of the asynchronous operation using `.then()` and `.catch()`. This ensures that the client receives feedback, either success or failure, improving the user experience and enabling more robust error handling.
